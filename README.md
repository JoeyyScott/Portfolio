# My Portfolio

Hello there! I'm Joeyy, I want to make a difference in the world.

## Description

I've self taught various skills over my 27 years of living. I've struggled with a fair amount mentally and finally have the confidence in myself to persue my dreams.

One of my main passions has been graphic design and minor web development as well as the gaming community. These three combined meant I was producing custom logos, headers, banners and graphics for content creators for a number of years.

I recently started a Full Stack Web Developer course with [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net) to bring my web dev skills to an industry standard as well as my many ideas, to life.

This is a work in progress and will be updated over time to reflect my skills. I've always been a dreamer and I thought what better place to combine all my talents in one place? Welcome to my portfolio.
